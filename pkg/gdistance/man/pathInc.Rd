\title{Incidence of paths from a common origin: overlap and non-overlap}
\description{
Calculate the overlap and non-overlap of two paths departing from a common origin. Two algorithms to are available: random walk and randomised shortest paths.}
\usage{
pathInc(transition, origin, fromCoords, toCoords, type, theta, weight)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{transition}{transition matrix (class Transition)}
  \item{origin}{coordinates of the origin (one point location, SpatialPoints, matrix or numeric class)}  
  \item{fromCoords}{coordinates of the destinations (SpatialPoints, matrix or numeric class)}
  \item{toCoords}{second set of coordinates of the destinations (only "missing" implemented)}
  \item{type}{a vector of one or two calculation types c("divergent","joint")}  
  \item{theta}{value > 0 and < 20 (randomised shortest paths) or missing (random walk)}
  \item{weight}{weight matrix -- Reciprocals of the non-zero values are used as weights. If missing, reciprocals of the transition matrix are used.}
}
\details{
This function calculates the overlap and non-overlap in the random walk trajectories or randomised shortest paths originating in a single point to sets of other locations.

First, probabilities of passage are calculated for each cell-to-cell connection. 

The shared path is calculated as:

Pjoint = Pi * Pj 

Divergence is calculated as: 

Pdivergent = max(0, max(Pi, Pj) * (1 - min(Pi, Pj)) - min(Pi, Pj))

Both are summed over all connections ij in the transition matrix.
