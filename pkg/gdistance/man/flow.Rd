\title{Flow: path overlap and non-overlap}
\description{
Calculate the overlap and non-overlap of two paths departing from a common origin.}
\usage{
flow(transition, originCoord, fromCoords, toCoords, norml, type)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{transition}{transition matrix (class Transition)}
  \item{originCoord}{coordinates of the origin (one point location, SpatialPoints class)}  
  \item{fromCoords}{coordinates of the destinations (SpatialPoints class}
  \item{toCoords}{second set of coordinates of the destinations (optional, SpatialPoints class)}
  \item{norml}{normalisation to values between 0 and 1}
  \item{type}{a vector of one or two calculation types c("divergent","joint")}  
  
}
\details{
This function calculates the overlap and non-overlap in the random walk trajectories originating in a single point to sets of other locations.

Probabilities of joint passage or divergence are calculated for each cell-to-cell connection. These are multiplied by the resistance (1/conductance) of each connection and summed.
}
\value{
dist object (when toCoords lacks)
matrix (when toCoords is given)

\note{ 

The function needs to be optimized and requires much calculation time when Transition objects are large.
